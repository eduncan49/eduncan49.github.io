            <li>Swaddling</li>

		</ul>
				    <p>Our nurses can also do maternal blood pressure checks and newborn weight checks, if clinically indicated.</p> 

<p>Maybe you’re a new mom and would like a little extra support as you get the hang of your new little love, or you’re a dad who wants some guided practice while mom gets a little rest. Perhaps this isn’t your first child, but it’s been a while since you bathed and swaddled a newborn, and you want to be up to date on the latest techniques and safety guidelines.</p> 

<p>Our postpartum nurses are here to reinforce the teaching from the hospital, answer all your questions, and empower you to feel confident in caring for your baby, all in the comfort of your own home.</p>
