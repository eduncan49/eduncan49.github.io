							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>I’ve heard from so many patients over the years about how hard it is to navigate the complicated health care system - and it has only gotten worse in recent years. Too many people aren’t getting the care they need because they don’t know where to start. 
							</p>
							<p>I’ve witnessed my own family members become exhausted as they struggled to manage chronic and terminal diagnoses via emails, phone calls and multiple visits to their doctor’s office. It wasn’t until I became the primary caregiver to my aunt and mother-in-law that I began to question how people navigated the healthcare system without a nurse in their lives. It is an overwhelming process that can sometimes feel as though you are drowning in decisions. </p>
							<p>Whether it’s coordinating follow-up care after hospitalization or a new diagnosis, managing chronic illnesses that often become more complicated with time, advising you during times of transition such as post-surgical periods, aggressive treatments, or palliative care and hospice… we can help guide and support you and your loved ones to ease the stress of caregiving and accompany you on your journey.</p>
							<p>The nurses at Hummingbird Concierge Nurse Consulting have experienced all of these situations in our own lives, and we want to share our expertise with you to make a stressful period easier, and give you the space you need - and deserve - to be the family, not the nurse. </p>
