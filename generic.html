							<p>I’ve heard from so many patients over the years about how hard it is to navigate the complicated health care system - and it has only gotten worse. Too many people aren’t getting the care they need because they don’t know where to start. 
							</p>
							<p>I’ve witnessed my own family members struggle to manage chronic and terminal diagnoses via emails, phone calls, and multiple visits to their doctor’s office. It wasn’t until I became the primary caregiver to my aunt and mother-in-law that I began to wonder how people navigated the healthcare system without a nurse in their lives. It is an overwhelming process that can feel as though you are drowning in decisions. </p>
							<p>I have had the privilege of working at one of the best hospitals in the world for the last 27 years. I’m constantly amazed at the advances in medicine and the benefit it brings to our patients. But what happens in the hospital is just the beginning, and the care coordination required after discharge is often multi-layered and confusing.</p>
							<p>I know firsthand how challenging it is to navigate the ongoing care for complex, progressive disease while also understanding the psychological impact chronic illness has on a patient and their family. Loss of independence, feelings of being a burden, even guilt and regret are all factors that impact families dealing with care management.</p>
							<p>Each nurse at Hummingbird Consulting has more than 25 years of professional experience at world renowned hospitals, coupled with personal experiences caring for their loved ones and managing a variety of complex health situations. I invited them to join this team because they are passionate about easing the burden that comes from coordinating care and advocating for patients within a healthcare system that is not user friendly.</p>
							<p>We know how hard it is to balance the needs of spouses, children, work, and sick loved ones in addition to trying to carve out some time for self-care. We have the benefit of tapping into our professional nursing experience to coordinate care for our family members, and we want to partner with you to make a stressful period easier, and give you the space you need - and deserve - to be the family, not the nurse.</p>
