                                <h3>Care Coordination</h3>
                                <p>Let us help coordinate your follow-up care after a recent hospitalization, rehab stay, as you process a new diagnosis, or deal with the progression of a chronic condition.</p>
				<p>Patients are often discharged from a very short hospital stay with a big stack of papers listing new diagnoses, new medications, and multiple follow-up visits that need to be scheduled. We will prioritize the to-do list to ensure all of your care is appropriately managed and lessen the stress that comes with navigating the health care system.</p>
                                <p>We will also assist you in making sure your patient portal is updated and review the best way for you to communicate with your care team.</p>

                                <p>Managing chronic illness can be overwhelming and leave you feeling like a detective who is trying to put the pieces of a puzzle together. We will guide you throughout the journey by providing a professional assessment of the situation and putting a plan of care together to help make the process smoother and less stressful. </p>

We will advise you on what to expect with your treatment plan and make suggestions to help ease the day-to-day process of care management.</p>

                                <p>We provide medication management and pill box fill. We will review your medications with you, answer any questions you may have, and confirm the schedule is correct and easy to follow to ensure compliance and avoid unnecessary complications. </p>

                                <h3>Palliative Care</h3>
                                <p>We offer holistic nursing assessments to help you discern if palliative care would be a good choice to meet your goals and will connect you with an expert, home-based palliative care team as we continue to support you along the way. These are emotional decisions that can be challenging for families. Having an experienced nurse as a guide can help reduce the strain that is often present in these situations. </p>

                                <h3>Hospice Support </h3>
                                <p>Hospice is a wonderful service that provides holistic care for the patient - and their family - as they face the final stages of life.  However, there is often a gap between the care that is provided and the support a family feels they need at such a delicate time.  We are experienced nurses who have been in your shoes caring for a loved one at home on hospice. We are here to help support and guide you as you journey along this difficult path. </p>

                                <h3>Community Services</h3>
                                <p>We will listen to your specific needs and connect you with high quality home-based community services to improve your quality of life. We have managed care for loved ones while juggling work and our own family’s needs, and are familiar with the stress it can bring to your life. Having a nurse as an outside resource to assess the situation and make suggestions on how to alleviate some of those pressures will give you the space you need to be the family member, not the nurse. </p>

                                <h3>Extended Support Options</h3>
                                <p>In the fast-paced world of healthcare, it can feel as if the biggest issues get attention but the seemingly small things fall through the cracks. It is these smaller things that the family is left to manage, often without much direction. Let our nurses fill in the gaps and provide you with continued support after your covered services have ended to improve your quality of life. We can do this by:
                                </p>
                                <p>Reinforcing education surrounding health conditions, medications, and medical devices

                                <h3>Home Check-ins</h3>
                                <p>Peace of mind visits allow us to develop a trusting nurse-patient relationship to evaluate your loved one at their baseline and develop a plan for any area of concern before it becomes an urgent situation. This home care option is perfect for assessing chronic health issues for your elderly loved ones who would benefit from regular wellness checks in order to remain safe at home, or if you’re traveling and want to ensure your loved one is maintaining their schedule of medications and other established at-home treatment plans. 
                                    
                                    </p>
                                <p>One hour weekly check-ins are available for a high touch approach to monitor health conditions, so if the status quo changes, it can be addressed quickly and avoid hospitalization whenever possible.</p>

                                <h3>Communication</h3>
                                <p>Communication is at the core of our practice model.  With more than 25 years of experience as nurses at MGH, we know how critical communication is to successful healthcare management. We will listen to your story, then together, formulate questions for your care team in order to efficiently advocate for yourself or your loved ones to ensure these concerns are heard and addressed in a way that meets your needs.
