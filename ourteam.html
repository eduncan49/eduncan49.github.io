				    <p>Elizabeth Duncan is the founder of Hummingbird Concierge Nurse Consulting. She graduated from Boston College School of Nursing, and has spent her 28 year career at Massachusetts General Hospital working in acute medical and perioperative nursing units. Over the years, she’s identified strong nurse advocacy and comprehensive patient and family education as key components to successful recovery at home.</p>
				<p>Elizabeth strives to honor the dignity of each person by providing compassionate, supportive, personalized care, and meeting the patients where they are. She knows every patient has a story, and holds specific hopes for how their health journey will unfold. Elizabeth’s goal is to provide each patient with the opportunity to share those plans, then act as a guide and advocate to help achieve them, making the necessary adjustments along the way.</p>
				<p>At her home, nursing and life are intertwined, and Elizabeth embraced the opportunity to become the primary caregiver for the remarkable women in her family as they aged, and then again as they faced end of life issues. Elizabeth saw rapid improvement in the quality and efficiency of their care once she started coordinating the many services involved, and her mission is to share that expertise with others. This experience became the catalyst for developing Hummingbird Consulting.</p> 
			 	<p>Personalized, nurse-guided navigation is the missing ingredient to effective health care coordination. The founding principle of Hummingbird is based on Elizabeth’s mantra - that every family needs a nurse.</p>
				<p>Elizabeth lives with her husband, their five children, four chickens, and sweet chocolate lab. Her mother also lives with them, to ensure everyone behaves. This family foundation has been the bedrock of her calling to care for and accompany others on their healthcare journey, embracing joy along the way. She loves finding new ice cream stands with her family, laughing with her sisters, listening to live music, and can recite Ocean's Eleven by heart.</p>
